## RPG Game


</div>

### Description

This is built off of the RPG combat engine that I submitted before. I have added Character creation(sorta), Random monsters, Eperience points system, level gaining system, Gold system, and a new interface. It it compleatly playable. The number systems still need to be worked out a little. I would eventually like to make this like old wizardry, perhaps multi-player. If anyone could tell me anything about writing a server and implimenting online play, It would be greatly appreciated. The next major step in the game will be to create some type of a graphic system, so that the player can adventure. If anyone has any ideas or tips on how to do this, please let me know. I think it would be cool to put a tile based map,etc.. in the picturebox.
